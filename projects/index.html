          <h2>Triangle Classification</h2>
          <p>
            A triangle can be classified across a few dimensions, one of which is based on
            the lengths of its sides.
          </p>
          <p>
            A triangle is <strong>scalene</strong> if all of its three sides are different.
          </p>
          <p>
            If two of its sides are equal, a triangle is called <strong>isosceles</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A triangle with all three equal sides is called <strong>equilateral</strong>.
          </p>
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            Create a class "TriangleClassifier" with the following method:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>classify(len1, len2, len3)</dt>
            <dd>This method accepts three numeric values each representing
              the length of one side of a triangle. It returns a symbol,
              :scalene, :isosceles, or :equilateral, where the return value
              corresponds to the actual type of the triangle.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            In addition, the classify method should perform error checking if the given
            lengths of the sides cannot correspond to a real triangle. In this case, it
            should return the symbol :error.
          </p>

          <h2>Bowling Kata</h2>
          <p class="notice">
            The following description of the Bowling Kata is taken from Uncle Bob Martin's
            original description of the kata, available
            <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata">at his site</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A game of bowling consists of 10 frames. In each frame the player has
            two opportunities to knock down 10 pins. The score for the frame is the total
            number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.
          </p>
          <p>
            A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two tries. The bonus for
            that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll. So in frame 3
            above, the score is 10 (the total number knocked down) plus a bonus of 5 (the
            number of pins knocked down on the next roll.)
          </p>
          <p>
            A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first try. The bonus
            for that frame is the value of the next two balls rolled.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the extra
            balls to complete the frame. However no more than three balls can be rolled in
            tenth frame.
          </p>
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            Write a class named “Game” that has two methods:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>roll(number_of_pins)</dt>
            <dd>This method is called each time the player rolls a ball.
                The argument is the number of pins knocked down.</dd>
            <dt>score()</dt>
            <dd>This method is called only at the very end of the game.
                It returns the total score for that game.</dd>
          </dl>
        </div>

        <div class="description" id="roman-numeral-calculator">
          <h2>Roman Numeral Calculator</h2>
          <p class="notice">
            The Roman Numeral Calculator problem in this form was originally laid
            out as part of the Ruby Quiz series. See the original problem
            <a href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz22.html">Ruby Quiz 22</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this exercise is to create a a utility that accepts an integer
            (between 1 and 3999) expressed as an Arabic or Roman numeral and returns the
            same value in the opposite format.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the following sequence of inputs:
          </p>
          <pre>
          III
          29
          38
          CCXCI
          1999
          </pre>
          <p>would yield the following outputs:</p>
          <pre>
          3
          XXIX
          XXXVIII
          291
          MCMXCIX
          </pre>
          <p>
            If you're not familiar with or need a refresher on Roman numerals, the rules are
            fairly straightforward. First, there are seven letters associated with seven values:
          </p>
          <pre>
          I = 1
          V = 5
          X = 10
          L = 50
          C = 100
          D = 500
          M = 1000
          </pre>
          <p>
            You can combine letters to add values, by listing them largest to smallest from left to right:
          </p>
          <pre>
          II is 2
          VIII is 8
          XXXI is 31
          </pre>
          <p>
            However, you may only list three consecutive identical letters. That requires a special
            rule to express numbers like 4 and 900. That rule is that a single lower value may proceed
            a larger value, to indicate subtraction. This rule is only used to build values not
            reachable by the previous rules:
          </p>
          <pre>
          IV is 4
          CM is 900
          </pre>
          <p>But 15 is XV, not XVX.</p>
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            Create a class "RomanNumeralCalculator" with the following method:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>calculate(number)</dt>
            <dd>This method accepts a singlue numeric (integral) value
              in either Arabic or Roman Numeral format and returns the same
              value in the opposite format. The method should return valid
              results for input ranging from 0 to (at least) 3999.

          <h2>Triangle Classification</h2>
          <p>
            A triangle can be classified across a few dimensions, one of which is based on
            the lengths of its sides.
          </p>
          <p>
            A triangle is <strong>scalene</strong> if all of its three sides are different.
          </p>
          <p>
            If two of its sides are equal, a triangle is called <strong>isosceles</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A triangle with all three equal sides is called <strong>equilateral</strong>.
          </p>
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            Create a class <span class="code">TriangleClassifier</span> with the following method:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>classify(len1, len2, len3)</dt>
            <dd>This method accepts three numeric values each representing
              the length of one side of a triangle. It returns a symbol,
              <span class="symbol">:scalene</span>, <span class="symbol">:isosceles</span>,
              or <span class="symbol">:equilateral</span>, where the return value
              corresponds to the actual type of the triangle.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            In addition, the classify method should perform error checking if the given
            lengths of the sides cannot correspond to a real triangle. In this case, it
            should return the symbol <span class="symbol">:error</span>.

          <h2>Bowling Kata</h2>
          <p class="notice">
            The following description of the Bowling Kata is taken from Uncle Bob Martin's
            original description of the kata, available
            <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata">at his site</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A game of bowling consists of 10 frames. In each frame the player has
            two opportunities to knock down 10 pins. The score for the frame is the total
            number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.
          </p>
          <p>
            A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two tries. The bonus for
            that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll. So in frame 3
            above, the score is 10 (the total number knocked down) plus a bonus of 5 (the
            number of pins knocked down on the next roll.)
          </p>
          <p>
            A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first try. The bonus
            for that frame is the value of the next two balls rolled.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the extra
            balls to complete the frame. However no more than three balls can be rolled in
            tenth frame.
          </p>
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            Write a class named <span class="code">Game</span> that has two methods:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>roll(number_of_pins)</dt>
            <dd>This method is called each time the player rolls a ball.
                The argument is the number of pins knocked down.</dd>
            <dt>score()</dt>
            <dd>This method is called only at the very end of the game.
                It returns the total score for that game.</dd>

        <div class="description" id="roman-numeral-calculator">
          <h2>Roman Numeral Calculator</h2>
          <p class="notice">
            The Roman Numeral Calculator problem in this form was originally laid
            out as part of the Ruby Quiz series. See the original problem
            <a href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz22.html">Ruby Quiz 22</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this exercise is to create a a utility that accepts an integer
            (between 1 and 3999) expressed as an Arabic or Roman numeral and returns the
            same value in the opposite format.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the following sequence of inputs:
          </p>
          <pre>
          III
          29
          38
          CCXCI
          1999
          </pre>
          <p>would yield the following outputs:</p>
          <pre>
          3
          XXIX
          XXXVIII
          291
          MCMXCIX
          </pre>
          <p>
            If you're not familiar with or need a refresher on Roman numerals, the rules are
            fairly straightforward. First, there are seven letters associated with seven values:
          </p>
          <pre>
          I = 1
          V = 5
          X = 10
          L = 50
          C = 100
          D = 500
          M = 1000
          </pre>
          <p>
            You can combine letters to add values, by listing them largest to smallest from left to right:
          </p>
          <pre>
          II is 2
          VIII is 8
          XXXI is 31
          </pre>
          <p>
            However, you may only list three consecutive identical letters. That requires a special
            rule to express numbers like 4 and 900. That rule is that a single lower value may proceed
            a larger value, to indicate subtraction. This rule is only used to build values not
            reachable by the previous rules:
          </p>
          <pre>
          IV is 4
          CM is 900
          </pre>
          <p>But 15 is XV, not XVX.</p>
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            Create a class <span class="code">RomanNumeralCalculator</span> with the following method:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>calculate(number)</dt>
            <dd>This method accepts a single numeric (integral) value
              in either Arabic or Roman Numeral format and returns the same
              value in the opposite format. The method should return valid
              results for input ranging from 0 to (at least) 3999.

          <h2>Code Breaker Kata</h2>
          <p>
            In order to gain clearance to the super-secret area of the mad scientit's
            lab, you must crack the security code sequence randomly generated at the
            start of each day. The code is breakable, but you'll need to practice
            if you're going to crack it quickly enough to not get caught.
          </p>
          <p>
            The security code consists of a sequence of four colors, each element of which can
            be one of the following: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet, Pink, or
            Chartreuse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon entering sequence of four colors as a guess, the system will respond by
            indicating how many colors were correct but out of sequence and how many colors
            were both correct and in the correct spot in the sequence.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if the correct sequence of colors is RGBP, and the guess is GYBO then
            then response will indicate that one color was guessed correctly but out of place (G)
            and one color was guessed correctly and in the correct spot (B)..
          </p>
          <p>
            This repeats until
            the full sequence has been entered correctly or the evil scientist discovers you and&hellip;
            deals with you.
          </p>
          <p>See an <a href="http://www.echalk.co.uk/Maths/PrimaryNationalStrategy_Yr6/DfES-MathsActivitiesforyear6/code.html">online example here</a>.</p>
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            Create a class <span class="code">CodeBreakerSimulator</span> with the following method:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>evaluate_guess(colors)</dt>
            <dd>This method accepts a sequence of four colors and returns
              a collection indicating the number of correct colors (indicated
              by <span class="symbol">:color</span>) and the number of correct colors in the correct place
              (indicated by <span class="symbol">:place</span>). These sets are mutually exclusive, so one
              correct color in the correct place should result in [<span class="symbol">:place</span>]
              being returned, not [<span class="symbol">:color</span>, <span class="symbol">:place</span>]
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            This simulator should be able to help you practice your color sequence cracking
            and hopefully avoid being caught in a mad scientist's lair! Good luck, we're all
            counting on you.

          <h2>Greed Scoring</h2>
          <p class="notice">
            The following description of the rules of Greed is taken from
            the Wikipedia article here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greed_%28dice_game%29">Greed Scoring</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greed is a dice game with complex scoring rules. The first player to have
            scored 10,000 or more points at the end of their turn wins.
          </p>
          <p>
            A turn involves one or more throws of the dice.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a player begins a turn, he throws all six dice. He then scores points for
            the turn (cumulatively) as per scoring below. If he fails to score any points
            on any given throw, he receives no points for his turn, his turn ends, and
            play passes to the person on his left. After each throw, the player sets aside
            any of the dice that scored points, and he may either continue to throw the
            rest of the dice or end his turn and take his points. The player then continues
            to throw all remaining non-scoring dice until:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>No points are scored on a throw</li>
            <li>The player decides to keep his score for the turn</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          In addition, if a player scores with all six dice over the course of his turn,
          he may continue rolling, starting again with six dice.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to enter the game, a player must achieve 1000 points in one turn (not throw).
          </p>

          <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
            <thead>
              <tr><td>Dice</td><td>Scores</td></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td>a single 1</td><td>100</td></tr>
              <tr><td>a single 5</td><td>50</td></tr>
              <tr><td>triple of 1's (1,1,1)</td><td>1,000</td></tr>
              <tr><td>triple of 2's (2,2,2)</td><td>200</td></tr>
              <tr><td>triple of 3's (3,3,3)</td><td>300</td></tr>
              <tr><td>triple of 4's (4,4,4)</td><td>400</td></tr>
              <tr><td>triple of 5's (5,5,5)</td><td>500</td></tr>
              <tr><td>triple of 6's (6,6,6)</td><td>600</td></tr>
              <tr><td>four-of-a-kind (2,2,2,2)</td><td>Multiply triple score by 2</td></tr>
              <tr><td>five-of-a-kind (3,3,3,3,3)</td><td>Multiply triple score by 4</td></tr>
              <tr><td>six-of-a-kind (4,4,4,4,4,4)</td><td>Multiply triple score by 8</td></tr>
              <tr><td>three pairs (2,2,3,3,4,4)</td><td>800</td></tr>
              <tr><td>straight (1,2,3,4,5,6)</td><td>1,200</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
            If you set aside a triple of 5's, then rolled a single 5, you could not claim a
            four-of-a-kind. You could merely claim one triple of 5's, and one single 5. Your
            score would be 500 + 50 = 550.
          </p>
          <p>
            When rolling 4 or greater of a kind, each additional kind that is matched doubles
            your score. So if you rolled five 4's, your score would be 400 for the first 3.
            Then double that for the fourth, making it 800, then double again to make it 1600
            points. 400x2x2 = 1600.
          </p>
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            Create a tracker for a Greed game sequence. This is an open-ended problem. You
            may choose to focus on scoring individual throws, combining throws into rounds,
            tracking multiple players, or whatever palatable and interesting portion of the
            solution you choose.

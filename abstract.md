# Vital Testing
## Level: Intermediate

This workshop is for the testing-minded developer who would like to sharpen their testing skills. Are you unsatisfied with the your test coverage? Or maybe you find that your unit tests tend to break when you refactor. Or maybe you just can't seem to get your tests to help drive your design direction.

Whatever your testing shortcomings, this workshop will allow you to practice your testing skills is a series of short, focused coding exercises. The workshop will begin with a talk on testing strategies and skills covering things like: starting with failing test; selecting what to test next; making sure the test fails; focusing on behavior, not implementation; and writing readable, non-brittle tests.

After the talk you will participate in a testing self assessment to see where you need to improve. The rest of the workshop will be an opportunity to pair with like-minded individuals and practice those skills that need improvement.

Testing is no longer an optional part of software development, it is an integral part of writing solid code. Come join us as we improve this vital skill.
